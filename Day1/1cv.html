I tried to build up career paths to be the unique personnel to handle any business environment; This has been my primary and long-term goal in the proper position at the right company.</p>
  <p>I earned two degrees at the University of Alaska Anchorage (UAA); firstly, I completed a Master of Science in Project Management (M.S.P.M., 2015), focused on analyzing and planning Project/Program management and concentrating on quality and business process management.

  <p>I worked as a Project Manager (2013 – 2015) at Link Project Planning and Consulting, a locally based PM consulting company. My work focused on consulting and analyzing the financial planning of a new project based on a business feasibility test and market research. All provided information complied with the standard of PMI’s PM Body of Knowledge (PMBOK) guide and Generally Accepted Accounting Principle (GAAP). The suggested solutions for financial tasks result from Cost-Benefit Analysis (e.g., NPV, PI, ARR, and IRR) through a cross-sectional approach and CVP Analysis (B.E.P. Analysis). Also, I provided project progress reports and forecasted future expenditures by offering tools and a matrix of the Key Performance Index (KPI) of risk management in the concepts of both FP&A and Project Management.</p>
  <p>Also, I worked as a Project Management Contract assistant (2014) at UAA Facilities Planning and Construction (FP&C) while earning a master’s degree. I got involved with the final stage of construction of the UAA aviation center and other projects. The task of my position focused on the contracts with vendors (the max. budget of $0.3M; contract form: mostly Time & Material: T&M).

The Not-for-Profit Native Corporation operates 19 health care programs and dental eight sites in Eastern Aleutian cities for locals). My tasks were on financial and budget management. Funds and grants mainly came from the AK State government and Federal Government.
